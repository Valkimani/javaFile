// Manually building the application
* This is a basic gradle init project using Groovy to generate the build file.
gradle folder> gradlew > build.gradle. Using rollbar dependency

// Flow:
- The app defines a work object,
- Instantiates a single instance of the work object and,
- Executes some methods.

gradlew will be used to build the application. Go under gradle folder
gradlew > build.gradle
Using rollbar dependency

// Notes:
* look up com.google.guava:guava:31.1-jre
* App src app.java is where the java file/ package javafile is
* Build and run for execution
./gradlew build
./gradlew run OR ./gradlew build run
creates app.jar and other temporary files converted into gibberish file than can be executed quickly

* Environment. Must use the correct spelling to be able to build
* Environment and codeVersion quotes are wrong should be ""
* Edit public static void main(String[] args) by adding throws Exception
